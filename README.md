The Bioscope is a project that aims to create a movie streaming website. This platform will allow users to browse through a collection of over 50 movies stored in cloud-based storage, with each movie linked to metadata like title, director's name, rating, and a 'Watch Now' button. The website is built using the Django framework for the backend, while the frontend is designed with HTML and CSS to provide a clean, user-friendly interface.

Key features of the Bioscope platform include:

A well-organized display of movies, each with essential information and a watch option. A cloud-based storage solution to store and retrieve the movies. A responsive and easy-to-navigate UI.
